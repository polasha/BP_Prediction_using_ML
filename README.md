# Cuff less Blood Pressure Prediction 

This repository hosts the code for Prediction of Blood Pressure from ECG and PPG signals using two methods.

1. Feature Extraction and Regression using Machine Learning Methods. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809420300987"> Paper </a>




### Getting Started:


```

### Dataset:

Dataset :  [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00340/)

This database consist of a cell array of matrices, each cell is one record part. 

In each matrix each row corresponds to one signal channel: 

1: PPG signal, FS=125Hz; photoplethysmograph from fingertip 

2: ABP signal, FS=125Hz; invasive arterial blood pressure (mmHg) 

3: ECG signal, FS=125Hz; electrocardiogram from channel II 

Processed version of the data from UCI repository used for our experiments: [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n24ahZCxAAdkkmCfVrQeZXsSl4w0P6Jg?usp=sharing)

1. Cleaned folder contains BP records after thresholding them according to Kauchee et al. 2017

2. GT contains the ground truth SBP, DBP, MAP and class number (depending on the threshold). Ignore the class column as it has not been used for any experiments reported in the papers. 

3. data folder is the whole data as taken from UCI repository.


## Feature Extraction and Machine Learning based method:

### Prerequisites:

- MATLAB
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn

### Feature Extraction

The features taken are explained <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cufflessbp/features-notes">here </a>

<code> seven_features.m </code> - Code to extract the features : (WN,PIR,PTT,HR,IH,IL,Meu)

<code> ppg_features.m </code> - Code to extract the PPG features 

<code> PTT_final.m </code> - Code to extract the PTT 

The extracted features are saved in a CSV file from MATLAB.

The CSV file : <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/19mflxMXKuGKNLUM8Uirgg1P0JeguRs7e/view?usp=sharing"> Link </a>
The columns denote the features and BP GT in the same order as extracted.

### Machine Learning models

```bash
cd models_ML
python rf.py
```


## Using the DL Code:

### Prerequisites:

- Linux 
- Python 3 
- Pytorch

### Training

```bash
cd models_DL/cnn_lstm_concat
python cnn_multitask.py
```

### Testing 


```bash
cd models_DL/cnn_lstm_concat
python cnn_test.py
```
### Disclaimer

The code is not completely clean as the data directories are initialized manually. Please make sure the directories are changed according to the remote server where the code is run.
